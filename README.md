# Note Taker

## Description
This is an app to write and save notes. This was built for others to organize their thoughts in one place and keep track of tasks they need to complete in their busy lives. This app also allows the user to delete a completed task. By building this project, I learned how to build the back end using Express.js, connect to the front end, create data persistence by writing to/reading from files, and deploy the application to Heroku.
